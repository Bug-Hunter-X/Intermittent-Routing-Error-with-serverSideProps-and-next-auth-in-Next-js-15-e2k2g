# Intermittent Routing Error with serverSideProps and next-auth in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 when using `getServerSideProps` with `next-auth`.  The About page intermittently fails to load, displaying a blank screen or a routing error. This seems to be more prevalent after successful authentication. 

## Bug Description

The `about.js` page utilizes `getServerSideProps` to fetch session data using `next-auth`.  However, under certain conditions (potentially related to race conditions or caching), the page fails to render correctly, resulting in an error or a blank screen.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.  Refresh the page multiple times to observe the intermittent failure.

## Potential Causes

* Race conditions between `getServerSideProps` execution and client-side rendering.
* Caching issues related to authentication state.
* Interaction between `next-auth` and `getServerSideProps` within Next.js 15's updated architecture.

## Solution

The solution provided in `aboutSolution.js` incorporates error handling and potential mitigation strategies for these issues.
